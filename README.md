# FinTech Case Study: Binance

## Overview and Origin

Binance (the name is a portmanteau of Bitcoin and finance) is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. The company was founded in China in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao but is currently incorporated in the Cayman Islands. It is estimated that Zhao, commonly known as "CZ", owns 90% of the firm based on his public statements and regulatory filings.  

CZ a Chinese-born immigrant to Canada graduated with a computer science degree and put his skills and knowledge to use in his early career developing high-frequency trading systems for stock brokers. Then in 2013 he learned about Bitcoin during a game of poker and decided to go all-in on crypto, even going so far as selling his apartment to buy Bitcoin. For the next couple of years he worked for crypto wallet provider Blockchain.info and crypto marketplace OKCoin. Then in 2015 he started a company called Bijie Tech which provided cloud-based trading technology to various Asian exchanges. When he launched Binance, CZ populated the senior ranks with developers and engineers from Bijie Tech. 

Building on the expertise and insight CZ gained in these previous roles, the Binance cryptocurrency exchange was lauched after an initial coin offering (ICO) in July 2017. BNB tokens were dispersed among participants with 80 million (40%) going to the founding team, 20 million (10%) going to angel investors and 100 million (50%) available via public auction. The tokens available for public sale were sold for 15 cents each which raised a total of $15 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Binance was opened as a crypto exchange a mere eleven days later.   

According to Cruchbase, Binance has raised a total of $25 million in funding over 3 rounds with the lead investors being Vertex Ventures, Black Hole Capital and Funcity Capital. Separately, Binance.US, the American franchise of the company raised a seed round of $200 million recently giving the franchise a unicorn status with a $4.5 billion valuation. These investors include RRE Ventures, Foundation Capital, Original Capital, Van Eck and Circle Ventures. Binance.US CEO Brian Shroder has also publicly targeted an initial public offering (IPO) in 2024-25 depending on company performance and market conditions.   

## Business Activities

Beyond operating the world's leading crypto exchange, Binance is intended to encompass a vast ecosystem. Specifically they claim their vision is to increase the freedom of money globally and their mission is to be the infrastructure services provider for the blockchain ecosystem.   

This ecosystem includes: Binance Academy, an open access hub for blockchain and crypto learning resources. Binance Charity, a not-for-profit foundation dedicated to advancing blockchain-enabled philanthropy. Binance Info, an open access crypto-encyclopedia. Binance Labs, a fund to incubate blockchain projects. Binance Launchpad, a token launch platform for entrepreneurs. Binance Research, an institutional-grade resource for research reports. Trust Wallet, a secure decentralized wallet. Binance Smart Chain, a community-driven blockchain software system and Binance DEX, a decentralized exchange developed on top of Binance Smart Chain.   

With a 67% market share, Binance Exchange appeals to experienced crypto enthusiasts as it provides all the features that an advanced trader desires. However, there is also the option to switch from an advanced view to a basic view. This caters to a wider audience who don’t need all the sophisticated trading tools on offer. The firm offers trading in more than 500 coins on its international exchange, more than double of what’s offered by competitor Coinbase. Binance also offers some of the cheapest fees at 0.1% per trade and even less when using BNB tokens.  

The majority of developers at Binance use C++ to build the exchange and back-end trading engine. Most of the machine learning is written in Python. DevOps engineers and operations staff are using languages such as Go or Java for front-end web apps and Ruby on Rails for API services. Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network used by Binance which is operated by Amazon Web Services. It provides a globally-distributed network of proxy servers that cache content locally to consumers, thus improving access speed. Binance Coin initially ran on the Ethereum blockchain with ERC 20 standard but has since become the native coin of the Binance Smart Chain, although it is still written in Solidity the language developed for smart contracts by the Ethereum core contributors.   

## Landscape

Given that Binance deals primarily in cryptocurrencies, it can be seen to sit within the FinTech domain of Alternative Finance. This domain differs from traditional banking or capital market finance through technology-enabled 'disintermediation'. However, Binance itself as a company is not as decentralized as the tokens it enables customers to trade. Although confusingly, a decentralized peer-to-peer exchange is one of the services Binance provides in addition to it's main, more streamlined centralized exchange which holds customers' private keys.

Alternative Finance has grown into a considerable global industry following the financial crisis of 2008. Disatisfaction with the publicly funded bailouts of the too-big-to-fail banks was seen to be one of the motivations for the creation of Bitcoin, a deflationary currency without a central authority. The great innovation of Bitcoin was the blockchain, a distributed public ledger implemented as a chain of blocks, each containing a cryptographic hash of the previous blocks. Blockchain technology has proved to be versitile, enabling the creation of other decentralized smart contracts featuring the traceability of data across a shared network. Other Alternative Finance innovations of the past decade include crowdfunding, where funding for a project is provided by a large number of people online and peer-to-peer lending where online services match lenders with borrowers. 

There are many centralized crytpocurrency exchanges, two that stand out as being direct competitors to Binance are Coinbase and FTX. Coinbase was founded 5 years earlier than Binance (a long time in crypto terms) in June 2012. It was founded in San Francisco, however it is a remote-first company with no physical headquaters. Coinbase is currently the largest crypto exchange in the United States by trading volume. It can boast what is refered to as the "Coinbase Effect" which is the rise in price of cryptocurrencies listed for sale on its exchange in the days after news becomes public. This effect plays a big role in what cryptocurrencies gain widespread acceptance. FTX on the other hand is only 3 years old but is growing rapidly and already has over one million users. It was founded by MIT graduates Sam Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang and is headquartered in the Bahamas. In July 2021, FTX raised $900 million at a $18 billion valuation from over 60 investors including Softbank and Sequoia Capital. Binance itself was actually an investor in the company in 2020 but divested its share in 2021. In the same way that CZ is a charasmatic focal point for media profiles of Binance, Sam Bankman-Fried has made waves in the media as a supporter of effective altruism. He pursues 'earning to give' as an altruistic career and plans to donate the majority of his wealth over the course of his life.         

## Results

Centralized crypto exchanges reported $1.8 trillion in trading volume 2021, a 689% increase from 2020. With a 67% market share, Binance had over $1.2 trillion of that volume. That equates to 1.4 million transaction per second for Binance. Binance’s main competition are Coinbase (12.3%), FTX (6.6%), Kraken (3.2%), LMAX Digital (2.7%) and Bitfinex (2.5%). Binance generated at least $20 billion of revenue last year, that’s almost triple what analysts expect Coinbase collected for 2021. Decentralized exchanges had over $1 trillion in trading volume in 2021 but are growing even quicker with a massive 858% increase over 2020 trading volumes. Uniswap dominates the DEX market with a 75% market share. Uniswap is charging a 0.05% transaction fee on a $100,000 trade whereas CEXs Binance, Coinbase and Kraken are charging 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.2%, respectively. 

## Recommendations

Unfortunately, due to changes in Australian regulations in October 2021, Binance ceased offering Futures Trading to Australian users. I'm not recommending they change this but one of the differences between the Futures Trading interface and the regular Spot Trading interface is that more kinds of order type are offered, including a Trailing Stop Order. I would like to see the Trailing Stop Order added to the regular Spot Trading interface. This change would be easy to make as they already have this capability built into their app, it would require no additional technologies. 

I don't believe the changes in financial regulations that deemed the Futures Trading interface too risky for Australian retail traders has any bearing on the Trailing Stop Order. In fact, this order type can be used to prevent financial loss. A Trailing Stop Order is placed just like an ordinary Stop Loss, the difference is that unlike a typical Stop Loss which is static, a Trailing Stop Order will follow the price as it moves up and wait if the price moves down. The distance at which the Trailing Stop Order follows the price can be determined as a percentage. I know that as a user of Binance myself, I would love to have this capability. The only reason I can see that it is not offered is that a decision has been made to keep the regular Spot Trading interface simpler. However, I think keeping things simpler conflicts with the success they have had providing experienced crypto enthusiasts with advanced options. Simplicity should be confined to the users who chose the basic view with less options.
